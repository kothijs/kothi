## Contact

**security@kothi.js**

At Kothi.js, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. As a restaurant backend framework that handles sensitive data including payment information, order details, and customer data, security is paramount to our mission. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our users and our systems.
